# **_Inline cache implementation in HLS_** #


Â In the cache design proposed by Ma et al, the data is transferred from the global DRAM to the local on-chip SRAM buffers and the cache parameters can be reconfigurable with minimal changes in the source code they have written. General flow chart of the system given below and you can implement the IP block using given source code. For further information please follow [Github]()
